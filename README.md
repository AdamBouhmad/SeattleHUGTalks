# SeattleHUGTalks
Welcome to the Seattle HashiCorp Users Group!

We invite you to share your knowledge and expertise with the broader PNW community. If you have a talk idea related to HashiCorp tooling, we'd love to hear from you! Submit your talk proposal by creating a github issue, or by navigating to this [link](https://github.com/AdamBouhmad/SeattleHUGTalks/issues/new/choose). 


Talks must be between 15 and 30 minutes for us to consider them. Our next event will be on Friday, July 28th.
